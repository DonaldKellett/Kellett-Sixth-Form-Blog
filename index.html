										<h3>Personal Statements: Economics</h3>
										<p>
											Those of you applying to study Economics at university may find the following booklet helpful: <a href="http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/files/UCAS-Economics-Advice-Spring2012.pdf" target="_blank">http://www.tutor2u.net/blog/files/UCAS-Economics-Advice-Spring2012.pdf</a>.  It was written by Geoff Riley, the Head of Economics at Eton and co-founder of Tutor2U.
										</p>
										<p>
											The following sections are particularly helpful:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Section 3: Tips on strengthening a university application</li>
											<li>Section 4: Writing a personal statement for Economics</li>
											<li>Section 5: Sample personal statements</li>
										</ol>

										<h3>New Feature: Smiley Face Character Recognition</h3>
										<p>
											I am glad to announce that as of 03/10/15, this blog is able to recognise certain text patterns as smiley faces and convert the text equivalent to actual smiley faces :)!  That's right, you just saw a smiley face in my previous sentence!
										</p>
										<p>
											Currently, this blog can identify and convert 4 smiley faces:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li><code>:</code> + <code>)</code> = :)</li>
											<li><code>:</code> + <code>D</code> = :D</li>
											<li><code>:</code> + <code>p</code> = :p</li>
											<li><code>;</code> + <code>)</code> = ;)</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											So from now on, for the commenting and blogging requests, apart from HTML format, smiley face characters are also supported!  How cool is that? ;)  Feel free to leave comments below! :D
										</p>

										<p>
											As of 03/10/15, two new smiley faces have been added:
										</p>
										<ul>
											<li><code>:</code> + <code>(</code> = :(</li>
											<li><code>:</code> + <code>o</code> = :o</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											Enjoy! :D

										<h4>1. Using the Service</h4>
										<p>
											By using this Service, you agree to be bound by the following Terms:
										</p>
										<ol>
											<li>You agree, at all times, to login to the account you are assigned <b>only</b>.  Even if someone else willingly tells you their login username and password, do not login using their login details in <i>any</i> circumstances.  If you are caught using someone else's username and password with or without their consent, your account will be banned immediately.  In the case of a repeated violation of this Rule, your account may be banned or removed permanently.</li>
											<li>You agree, at all times, to keep your own login username and password secure.  At any point in time, the only people having access to your username and password should be (1) <b>you</b> and (2) the Administrator of this blog, <b>Donald</b>.  If you are caught violating this Rule, an account ban will commence immediately, which will typically last for approximately one week.  In the case that you repeatedly violate this Rule, your account may be banned or removed permanently.</li>
											<li>You agree, at all times, to use the Service as is provided.  In no circumstances should you attempt to exploit deficiencies in the code of this blog.  If this blog and its associated Services are used as is, there are normal security measures that will prevent you from accessing certain Services or Features if your Rank is not high enough.  However, if you are found scanning through the blog code for no (valid) reason or if you are found hacking the blog to gain access to certain Services, you will receive an account ban immediately depending on the severity.  In extreme cases, your account may be banned or removed permanently and worse still, the issue may be brought to the Local Court if necessary.</li>
											<li>You agree, at all times, to send commenting, blogging or user ban requests (depending on your rank) as soon as it appears on your Mail.  In no circumstances shall you attempt to modify the content or format of the automatically generated mail.

In extreme cases, your account may be permanently banned or removed.</li>
											<li>You agree, at all times, to respect the decision(s) made by the Moderators, Supermoderators and Administrator of this Blog.  You further understand that any action taken by the Administrator in this blog is <em>final</em>.  In no circumstances shall you act against the will of the Administrator within this Blog and its associated services.  For example, if a thread is closed (i.e. commenting is no longer allowed), if you still send a commenting request regarding the affected thread, the Administrator of this Blog has every right to ignore your commenting request.  In the case that you repeatedly send commenting requests for a closed thread, the Administrator has each and every right to impose a week-long ban on your account at any time and for any reason.</li>

In no circumstances should you attempt to copy (automatically or manually) and/or reuse the blog code in your website or any other website (or equivalent) UNLESS you have coded it from scratch without knowledge of the code used in this blog and BY CHANCE the code turns out to be very similar to that used in this Blog.

										<p>
											In case you haven't noticed, the background color of this blog post is different from that of the other blog posts on this page (a dark blue color instead of the usual dark green) and there is a lock next to the title of the thread (Terms of Service).  This means that this thread is closed.  If you send commenting requests regarding this thread or any other closed thread, it is a violation of the ToS and punishable by an account ban.

										<h3>Initial Post</h3>
										<p>Hello Year 12 and Year 13 Youde,</p>
										<p>Welcome to our new blog!  In this blog, Year 13s will be able to make blog posts about their university applications and Year 12s will be able to comment on their posts.  But before we start, please allow me to explain the system clearly.</p>
										<p>As you should all know, this is a private blog so you will have to login to view the content of the blog.  If you have not logged in to your account but can see this post, you are HACKING this blog (which of course is illegal).  After you log in to your account, if you hover your mouse pointer over the &quot;Menu&quot; bar, depending on your <b>rank</b> (details later), you should see some (or all if your rank is high enough) of these options:</p>
										<ul>
											<li>Home</li>
											<li>View Profile</li>
											<li>Request Comment</li>
											<li>Request Post</li>
											<li>Moderator Panel</li>
										</ul>
										<p>It should be obvious that the &quot;Home&quot; button returns you to this blog page.  As for the &quot;View Profile&quot; page, if you click on it, your profile details will appear, such as your blog name, your profile picture (if you don't have one, it defaults to the anonymous profile picture) and your rank in the blog.  Sensitive details such as your blog username and password will not appear for obvious reasons.</p>
										<p>Now, moving on to blog ranks.  There are a total of <b>8</b> ranks among the users of this blog:</p>
										<ol>
											<li>Banned</li>
											<li>Visitor</li>
											<li>Commenter</li>
											<li>Blogger</li>
											<li>Moderator</li>
											<li>Supermoderator</li>
											<li>Developer</li>
											<li>Administrator</li>
										</ol>
										<p>If you are Banned, you only have viewing rights in the blog which means you will not be able to do anything other than go to the homepage of view your own profile.  If you are a Visitor it is basically the same as Banned, but the status looks better.  Visitor accounts are for special guests such as universities if they wish to view the blog.  Commenters can view and comment; Bloggers can view, comment and blog; and Moderators and any rank above that have access to the Moderator Panel on top of everything.  An Admin Panel does not exist because in this blog, content is edited directly due to certain technological restrictions of the hosting platform I am using.</p>
										<p>
											Promotions of ranks will very rarely, if never, happen.  By default, all Year 12s are Commenters, Year 13s are Bloggers and Ms. Martin and Ms. Hills are Supermoderators.  A promotion will only occur if (1) Ms. Hills or Ms. Martin says so or (2) a Year 12 becomes a Year 13 in the next school year.  Demotions are also very rare.  However, you must be careful not to spam the Service provided by this blog and follow the <strong>Terms of Service</strong> rigorously; otherwise, the Moderators and Supermoderators of this blog will report you and you will be Banned for a week (or any other sensible time duration).
										</p>
										<p>
											Moving on to the commenting and blogging system, due to technological restrictions, this website cannot save comments and/or blog posts directly; therefore, I have created a workaround.  It basically works like this: you go to the &quot;Request Comment&quot; or &quot;Request Post&quot; page, and you will see a form that you can fill in.  Follow the instructions and fill the form in, then click &quot;Submit&quot; (or equivalent) and it should open up your Mail with a pre-typed email message.  DO NOT ALTER THAT MESSAGE.  All the pre-filled information is crucial in recognising which account made the request to comment or post.  I will then read the email and if I approve it, I will add the comment in your (account) name.
										</p>
										<p>
											For now, some features of the blog are still a bit bugged - for example, the &quot;Menu&quot; bar does not display 100% correctly - but it should not affect the functionality much.  However, unfortunately, there is no &quot;Report a Bug&quot; page at the time of writing so feel free to email directly to <a href="mailto:kellett6formblog@gmail.com">kellett6formblog@gmail.com</a> to report bugs.  One important thing though - remember to name the subject of your email <b>Kellett Sixth Form University Blog - Bug Report</b>.  Thank you for your cooperation!
										</p>
										<p>
											I will be creating a post on the <b>Terms of Service</b> soon.  Before this post comes out, please just use common sense while using the Service (i.e. no rude emails, no swearing, etc.).  Thank you very much and I am looking forward to your posts and comments!

										<p>The <strong>Terms of Service</strong> have been completed as of 01/10/15.  All users of the Blog and its Services are now firmly bound to the <strong>Terms of Service</strong>.</p>
										<p>
											Before you start posting and/or commenting on this Blog, please first read the <strong>Terms of Service</strong> carefully.  Anyone found violating the ToS will be punished accordingly.

										As of 01/10/15, the display of the content in the menu bar has been partially fixed.  Previously, the words in the dropdown menu bar were pink, but now they are white, which is how the links are supposed to look in the beginning.  However, at the time of writing, I am still unable to remove the dotted lines below the links for some reason.

											Almost forgot to mention - since this blog still does not have an &quot;Edit Profile&quot; page as of 06/10/15, if you want to edit your account details or anything - e.g. password, displayed Blog Name and/or profile picture (username and rank excluded) - feel free to directly email <a href="mailto:kellett6formblog@gmail.com">kellett6formblog@gmail.com</a>.  Just remember to name the subject of your email <b>Kellett Sixth Form University Blog - Edit Profile</b> and provide your blog username so I know which account to modify.

											Thank you for your cooperation. :)
